                    <h2>Introduction: Conceptual Foundation of the Research Program</h2>
                    <p>The modern era of artificial intelligence development requires rethinking Norbert Wiener's classical cybernetic principles and Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics through the lens of new technological capabilities and ethical challenges. Our working group can form an original research program aimed at developing the conceptual heritage of cybernetics in the context of modern artificial intelligence technologies and ethical imperatives. Based on the analysis of recent research, we see several promising directions that can become the foundation for innovative work at the intersection of technology, ethics, and social sciences.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Transformation of the Concept of Responsibility in an Algorithmic Society</h2>
                    <p>A critical direction of research should be rethinking the concept of responsibility in the era of algorithmic society. Modern scholars such as Jack Balkin and Frank Pasquale propose "new laws of robotics for the algorithmic society," inspired by Asimov's ideas but fundamentally directed at the human agents behind the development and use of artificial intelligence, rather than the AI systems themselves[1]. Within our working group, we can develop this concept by exploring various aspects of the responsibility of developers, users, and regulators in the AI ecosystem. The Responsible Research and Innovation model provides a fruitful basis for such analysis, allowing us to rethink the balance between technological progress and ethical constraints.</p>

                    <p>Special attention should be paid to how to preserve the human nature of responsibility in the face of risks of its dissolution in conditions of the increasingly significant role of artificial intelligence in our societies. Exploring the various meanings and contexts of the concept of "responsibility" in relation to AI systems can lead to the development of a new taxonomy of forms of responsibility applicable to various scenarios of human-machine interaction.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Synthesis of Computational Power and Human Wisdom</h2>
                    <p>A promising area of research is the development of the concept of synthesizing the computational power of artificial intelligence and human wisdom, proposed by Frank Pasquale in his book "New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI"[7]. Pasquale argues that the introduction of AI and robotics should be accompanied not only by technological limitations but also by legal and cultural constraints that guide their development. As a result of this approach, machines become not a replacement for human labor, but assistants that increase the value of human experience and expertise.</p>

                    <p>Within this direction, our working group can explore specific mechanisms for integrating human expertise and the computational capabilities of AI in various professional contexts. This includes developing methodologies for joint decision-making, where AI acts as a "cognitive tool" or "problem-solving partner," rather than an autonomous agent replacing a human. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of prompt engineering, where human creativity and understanding of context are complemented by the computational power of language models.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Overcoming Anthropocentrism in Artificial Intelligence Ethics</h2>
                    <p>Critical analysis of the limitations of Asimov's classic laws of robotics represents another promising area of research. Modern researchers note that Asimov's laws reflect a strongly anthropocentric model and are incompatible with contemporary movements in the field of self-determination and rights of non-human beings[4]. Our working group can develop a new ethical paradigm for artificial intelligence that overcomes the limitations of anthropocentrism, taking into account both human values and the potential autonomy and "subjectivity" of AI systems themselves.</p>

                    <p>This direction may include research on the possibility of extending moral status beyond human subjects, developing new concepts of "citizenship" or legal status for intelligent systems, and analyzing how different cultures and philosophical traditions can offer alternative approaches to human-machine relationships. It is important to explore how these new ethical perspectives can be translated into concrete legal and policy frameworks.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Educational Strategies for an Algorithmic Society</h2>
                    <p>The development of educational programs on artificial intelligence represents an important area of research with practical applications. The AI for K-12 initiative, created by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), is developing national guidelines for teaching AI to students from kindergarten through 12th grade[11]. Our working group can develop this concept by exploring effective ways to integrate an understanding of cybernetic principles and ethical aspects of AI into educational programs at various levels.</p>

                    <p>Of particular interest is the development of pedagogical approaches that help students not only understand the technical aspects of AI but also develop critical thinking about the social and ethical implications of technology. The results of research on the perception of ChatGPT by future educators[8] can inform the development of educational programs that prepare teachers to implement AI tools in the educational process in an ethically responsible manner.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Environmental Applications of AI and Cybernetic Principles</h2>
                    <p>The application of artificial intelligence to solve environmental problems represents a growing area of research with great potential. The InsectAI COST project is an example of an initiative aimed at using AI technologies for monitoring and conserving insects on a national and continental scale[14]. Our working group can explore how cybernetic principles can be applied to develop adaptive systems for monitoring and managing ecological processes.</p>

                    <p>This research direction may include developing new conceptual models for understanding ecological systems as cybernetic feedback systems, as well as creating innovative technological solutions for monitoring biodiversity and managing natural resources. Of particular interest is the development of ethically sound approaches to the use of AI for nature conservation that take into account not only human interests but also the well-being of other species and ecosystems as a whole.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Legal and Regulatory Aspects of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                    <p>The development of legal and regulatory frameworks for governing the development and implementation of AI represents a critical area of research. Contemporary discussions about optimal regulatory tools in the field of AI[16] emphasize the need for an interdisciplinary approach that combines technical, ethical, and legal perspectives. Our working group can contribute to this field by exploring how cybernetic principles of control and feedback can be translated into effective regulatory mechanisms.</p>

                    <p>Of particular interest is the analysis of how regulatory approaches can balance between stimulating innovation and ensuring the safety and ethics of AI systems. Research on various regulatory models, from industry self-regulation to detailed government control, can help develop adaptive regulatory approaches that evolve along with technology.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Conclusion: Integration of Research Directions</h2>
                    <p>The proposed research directions represent an interconnected program that can serve as the basis for the work of an interdisciplinary research group. The integration of technical, ethical, educational, environmental, and legal aspects of artificial intelligence will allow for the development of a holistic approach to AI development that takes into account both the opportunities and risks of these technologies. Of particular value is the rethinking of classical principles of cybernetics and the laws of robotics in the context of modern technological capabilities and social challenges.</p>

                    <p>The proposed research program not only continues the intellectual legacy of Norbert Wiener and Isaac Asimov but also develops it in new directions, responding to the challenges of the 21st century. The synthesis of computational power and human wisdom, rethinking the concept of responsibility, overcoming anthropocentrism, developing educational strategies, environmental applications of AI, and developing adaptive regulatory approaches â€” all these directions together create the basis for responsible and ethical development of artificial intelligence in the interests of humanity and the planet as a whole.</p>
